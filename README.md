Description-
  I had to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by a JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
